# March 27 - April 2

## Richard
You will be making a test server. Preferably on a Raspberry Pi, so you can start fresh. Lemme know if you need help flashing a fresh SD card.

You'll need to set up and install:

* The latest version of NodeJS (_not the one that you install via the built-in package manager (apt, etc)_).
* Webpack
    * [Here](https://blog.madewithenvy.com/getting-started-with-webpack-2-ed2b86c68783) is what looks to bea decent source for working with Webpack 2 (plus babel!). I know there isn't as much documentation for 2, but greenfield projects going forward will be using Webpack 2, and it isn't super different from 1.
* Babel
    * Remember to configure babel to work with ES2015 and React
    * Also needs to work with Webpack

If you get all of this running, you can look into setting up a production server.

## Chris
Look in to mocking up a simple scrum board with React. Nothing fancy, just get the core functionality:

* Creating new tasks
* Moving tasks between columns
* Editing tasks

This includes storing state *on the server*, not in the clients localstorage like the app that we're using right now.

Also, at least start the Lynda course on using Node and React. Yes, we all get it, you're very smart and know how Node works, and what a routing library does and how to generate and bundle React components. Go through it anyway to see if you can fill in sme gaps, like how to correctly manage client-side libraries with bower.

* read through this article, you don't have to sign up for the Udaicty course: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ui/responsive/

* apply what you learned from the article to your own portfolio site, use chrome's inspect tool to test your site at different viewports
