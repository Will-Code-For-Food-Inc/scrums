You will be making a test server. Preferably on a Raspberry Pi, so you can start fresh. Lemme know if you need help flashing a fresh SD card.

You'll need to set up and install:

* The latest version of NodeJS (_not the one that you install via the built-in package manager (apt, etc)_).
* Webpack
    * [Here](https://blog.madewithenvy.com/getting-started-with-webpack-2-ed2b86c68783) is what looks to bea decent source for working with Webpack 2 (plus babel!). I know there isn't as much documentation for 2, but greenfield projects going forward will be using Webpack 2, and it isn't super different from 1.
* Babel
    * Remember to configure babel to work with ES2015 and React
    * Also needs to work with Webpack

If you get all of this running, you can look into setting up a production server.
