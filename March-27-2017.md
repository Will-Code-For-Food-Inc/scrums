# March 27 - April 2

## Richard
You will be making a test server. Preferably on a Raspberry Pi, so you can start fresh. Lemme know if you need help flashing a fresh SD card.

You'll need to set up and install:

* The latest version of NodeJS (_not the one that you install via the built-in package manager (apt, etc)_).
* Webpack
    * [Here](https://blog.madewithenvy.com/getting-started-with-webpack-2-ed2b86c68783) is what looks to bea decent source for working with Webpack 2 (plus babel!). I know there isn't as much documentation for 2, but greenfield projects going forward will be using Webpack 2, and it isn't super different from 1.
* Babel
    * Remember to configure babel to work with ES2015 and React
    * Also needs to work with Webpack

If you get all of this running, you can look into setting up a production server.

## Chris
Look in to mocking up a simple scrum board with React. Nothing fancy, just get the core functionality:

* Creating new tasks
* Moving tasks between columns
* Editing tasks

This includes storing state *on the server*, not in the clients localstorage like the app that we're using right now.

* read through this article, you don't have to sign up for the Udaicty course: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ui/responsive/

* apply what you learned from the article to your own portfolio site, use chrome's inspect tool to test your site at different viewports
